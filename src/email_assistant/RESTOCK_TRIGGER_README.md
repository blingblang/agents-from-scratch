# Restock Trigger Agent - Automated Supplier Ordering

A sophisticated procurement automation agent built using LangGraph, following the same architecture as the email assistant. This agent manages supplier relationships, automates purchase order workflows, and ensures optimal inventory replenishment through intelligent supplier selection and cost optimization.

## Overview

The Restock Trigger Agent is designed to:
- **Automate supplier sourcing** and purchase order creation
- **Optimize procurement costs** through intelligent supplier selection
- **Manage supplier relationships** and performance tracking
- **Handle approval workflows** for large orders and critical decisions
- **Learn from procurement patterns** and adapt to business preferences
- **Integrate with Zoho Inventory** for seamless inventory management

## Architecture

The agent follows the same pattern as the email assistant with these components:

### 1. **Triage System**
- Analyzes restock triggers (stockout alerts, reorder requests, seasonal prep)
- Classifies urgency: `monitor`, `alert`, `action_required`
- Routes to appropriate procurement handling based on business impact

### 2. **Agent with Procurement Tools**
- **find_suppliers_tool**: Research suppliers with pricing and lead times
- **create_purchase_order_tool**: Generate purchase orders with selected suppliers
- **check_order_status_tool**: Track purchase order progress and delivery
- **approve_purchase_order_tool**: Approve orders and send to suppliers
- **cancel_purchase_order_tool**: Cancel orders with proper notifications
- **get_supplier_performance_tool**: Evaluate supplier metrics and ratings
- **bulk_restock_tool**: Plan and cost-optimize multiple item orders
- **Question**: Ask for approval or business input
- **Done**: Complete the procurement task

### 3. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**
- Approval workflows for orders over $1000
- Supplier selection confirmation for critical items
- Budget validation for large procurement activities
- Emergency order authorization

### 4. **Memory System**
- Learns supplier performance and reliability patterns
- Adapts approval thresholds based on user preferences
- Remembers cost optimization strategies and bulk ordering patterns
- Improves supplier selection based on past success rates

## Usage Examples

### Basic Stockout Alert Processing

```python
from src.email_assistant.restock_agent_hitl_memory import restock_trigger_agent
from src.email_assistant.restock_utils import create_stockout_alert_trigger

# Create a critical stockout alert
trigger = create_stockout_alert_trigger(
    item_name="USB Cable",
    current_stock=2,
    reorder_level=25,
    daily_consumption=15.2
)

# Run the agent
result = restock_trigger_agent.invoke({
    "restock_trigger": trigger
})
```

### Supplier Sourcing and Ordering

```python
from src.email_assistant.restock_utils import create_reorder_request_trigger

# Create a reorder request for multiple items
trigger = create_reorder_request_trigger(
    item_names=["Wireless Headphones", "Bluetooth Speaker"],
    quantities={"Wireless Headphones": 100, "Bluetooth Speaker": 75},
    budget_limit=15000.00
)

# Run the agent
result = restock_trigger_agent.invoke({
    "restock_trigger": trigger
})
```

### Emergency Order Processing

```python
from src.email_assistant.restock_utils import create_emergency_order_trigger

# Create an emergency order trigger
trigger = create_emergency_order_trigger(
    item_name="Critical Component",
    urgent_quantity=50,
    max_budget=5000.00,
    delivery_deadline="2025-01-20"
)

# Run the agent
result = restock_trigger_agent.invoke({
    "restock_trigger": trigger
})
```
